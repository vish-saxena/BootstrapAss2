        There was a time when schools and Colleges were the only source of Imparting knowledge and Education to the Children, 
        and now the Era has come where the students are studing onnline with the help of their mobile phone.
        Question is are they getting the correct of of Education? Will they Ever learn Discpline in their life?, 
        Will they be able to face people and challenges when they grow up, will they be fit Enough?
        Many such Question arises in my mind seeing my 14yrs nephew whole day occupied in the cell phone as to what will his future be.
        The lockdown and Covid has actiually effected the future of India. Not say that accepting technology is bad, but virtualisation in everything 
        is possibly not good for everyone. 
        The world is real so are we but ironically not even student even the adulters are caught in their own world of vitualisation.

        The new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 promises to be a game changer. The policy, approved by the Union cabinet in July,
         replaces the National Policy on Education 1986. The sector has been waiting for some big reforms for the past three decades and will 
         now undertake sweeping changes as
         laid down by the new policy, access, equality, affordability, quality and accountability will be the core focus areas.

        From a multidisciplinary approach to doing away with rote learning, from experiential learning to foundational literacy, and from vocational education, along with technical know-how, to learning in
         oneâ€™s mother tongue, NEP 2020 aims to transform the education space from pre-school to secondary levels and higher.
